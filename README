GCDNetworking is a framework for MacOS X which uses Grand Central Dispatch
to perform usually blocking operations.

It is inspired by the famous CocoaAsyncSocket by Robbie Hanson (http://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket)
but uses a dispatch_source_t as its engine.

For now, the framework is composed only by the GCDTcpSocket class,
but I have planned to add a GCDTcpServer and SSL capabilities for
both GCDTcpSocket and GCDTcpserver, I don't know maybe by subclassing
or using categories.
UdpSocket is planned as well.
