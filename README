GCDNetworking is a framework for MacOS X which uses Grand Central Dispatch
to perform usually blocking operations.

It is inspired by the famous CocoaAsyncSocket by Robbie Hanson (http://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket)
but uses a dispatch_source_t as its engine.

For now, the framework is composed by the GCDTcpSocket and GCDTcpServer
classes working both, asynchronous and synchronous.

Things to do:
* SSL
* UDP
